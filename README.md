# praxiphonoscope

Mozzi scratch using quadrature encoder from mouse.

## What ?

This piece was an augmentation of a hand made praxinoscope, a horizontal
pseudo-torical sculpture in rotation, controlling sound and physical
animations. A custom sub-millimetric encoder wheel is used to measure the
angular velocity and direction to scratch sounds embedded  in a tiny
electronic board.

## How ?

We used a custom encoded wheel imitating the mouse one, but much bigger, see
the svg file designed with inkscape.
It was made with a laser cutter, but should be possible with a 3d printer,
a vinyl cutter and a laser printer on transparent paper.

The sensor was attached to a laser cut wooden structure but here again,
a 3d printer would work, or even some simply bent metal wire...
The rotating element was a bike wheel but it's not the lightest so the inertia
is not that great. This wheel was attached on a metal bar, itself attached to
a heavy wood block to be stable.
To allow positioning the sensor accurately, a (hard drive) magnet was stuck to
its wooden holder.
